This is still very much work in progress. Don't expect too much just
yet, and in fact I'd probably wonder if it's useful to you at all at
this stage.

The multi-buffer DMA stuff seems a bit wacky; currently only having
1 active buffer works correctly at the moment. That seems to cause
about a 10% performance hit over double or more buffers...
