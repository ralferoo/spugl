Rasteriser inner loop

* Add Z buffer to rasteriser
* Add alpha blend to rasteriser
* Add stencil buffer to rasteriser
* Fix pixel offset error (centre at p+0.5, rather than p)
* Add support for oversampling, e.g. 2x2 RGSS (fig 5.29, Realtime Rendering)
* Rework texture lookup to support 32 textures
* Rewrite as assembler chunks that can be bolted together to make shaders

Block generation

* Ditch the intermediate storage of blocks, generate progressively by walking
  part a Hilbert curve
* Add workload negotitation code and use more than one SPU

Graphics pipeline

* Implement proper OpenGL pipeline rather than the current single projection
  matrix
* Revisit GLES spec to ensure I haven't missed anything fundamental
* Migrate towards GLES-like FIFO API rather than the current hotpotch

Main FIFO

* Rework memory recycling using the DMA "setvar" method instead of watching
  the read pointer - we might need to use areas of the buffer for vertex 
  buffers that are used after they are defined
* Tidy up macros
* Implement GLES compatible API to populate the FIFO

Other

* Shader compiler
* Profiling
