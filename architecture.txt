			Architecture notes for spugl
			----------------------------

Overview
--------

Much like with a modern graphics processor, the primary interaction with
the graphics "core" is via a FIFO command buffer. The "driver" places
instructions into the command buffer and, in the case of a graphics
processor, the GPU reads and executes these instructions independently
of the CPU. The the same way, spugl is designed such that an SPU thread
processes and executes the command buffer queue independently of the PPU
(or even SPU) that created the instruction stream.

Examples of instructions might be to bind a texture to a context, load
a transform (effectively setting input parameters to a vertex shader),
drawing a triangle or modifying memory.

The system is designed so that the FIFO is a block of memory "owned" and
managed by the client which contains instructions and data as well as a
pointer to the last instruction written. Internally, the processing core
maintains a pointer to the last instruction processed and each time it
is scheduled, it fetches and processes instructions until the two pointers
are equal. Writing to the command queue then becomes a very quick operation:

	// PROLOGUE
	unsigned int* command_queue;
	unsigned int* ptr = (unsigned int*) ( ((void*)command_queue) + (*command_queue) );

	// ISSUING INSTRUCTIONS
	*ptr++ = COMMAND1_ID;		// COMMAND1 takes 1 argument
	*ptr++ = data;

	*ptr++ = COMMAND2_ID;		// COMMAND2 takes no arguments

	// EPILOGUE
	__lwsync();
	*command_queue = ((void*)ptr) - ((void*)command_queue);
	__lwsync();

Where multiple instructions are to be queued, the prologue and epilogue only
needs to occur once, surrounding the block of instruction issues.

As the command buffer is finite, the client is responsible for managing the
buffer itself. To support that, the command queue instruction set includes
commands such as JMP so that the client can re-use the start of the buffer
when nearing the end and POKE so that the processing core can signal events
back to the client.

Managing resources
------------------

In order to provide resource seperation so that non-root processes can use
spugl and also to allow for spugl to be upgraded without affecting clients,
spugl is organised as a client-server model with a daemon process "spugld"
responsible for managing the SPU processes.

The biggest obstacle then becomes that both client and server need shared
access to the FIFO buffer and shared access to any texture data or pixel
buffers that are required - somehow both the server and client processses
must have access to the same buffers.

In spugl, a custom method of shared memory is implemented, built upon mmap
and tmpfs, which is fast and guarantees page coherency, and which allows
processes to share memory with others by passing the file descriptor to
another process. The actual process used isn't important, but knowing that
the "spugld" process is responsible for buffer management for all clients
is important.

It is also important to recognise that the block of memory will be mapped
at different addresses in both the client and server and all "addresses"
therefore are actually offsets from the start of the block. As multiple data
buffers might be required, a block id is often also required, for example
when binding a texture.

The methods defined in client.h wrap the client-server communication code
and provide:

	int SPUGL_connect();
	void SPUGL_disconnect(int server);
	void SPUGL_flush(struct CommandQueue* buffer);

	struct CommandQueue* SPUGL_allocateCommandQueue(int server, unsigned long size);
	void SPUGL_freeCommandQueue(struct CommandQueue* buffer);

	void* SPUGL_allocateBuffer(int server, unsigned long size);
	void SPUGL_freeBuffer(void* buffer);

Freeing a command queue or buffer happens immediately from the point of view
of the client and that region is no longer mapped in its address space. The
server, however, will retain that buffer in its address space until it is
no longer required (e.g. a buffer used for a texture is retained until any
render operations involving that texture have completed).

The flush operation waits until all pending operations on that queue have
completed; note that it might be removed as the POKE command can be used
for signalling instead.
