This document explains the general principles used in shader.c, with some notes for
precision of variables for when I'm moving it to integer based code.


So, consider a triangle ABC with some point P inside it, representing the
pixel currently being rendered. Each vertex A,B,C has a bunch of attributes
which can be interpolated in 3D space to provide the intermediate attribute
value at P (where attribute is something like pixel colour, texture coords,
etc).

However, because this interpolation must occur in 3D space, it's not
directly useful as we step through screen space.

However, considering the standard perspective transform
	\[ x_s = w - \frac{x D}{z-D} \]
	\[ y_s = h - \frac{y D}{z-D} \]
we see that it's possible to linearly interpolate over screen space over
$\frac{1}{z-D}$ (usually called w) and then recover the original 3D space
attributes by dividing by w. This process is generally known as $\frac{1}{z}$
interpolation and is a common result in most rasterising techniques.

From discussions with sparky in #ps3dev, I learned that P's attributes can be
interpolated using barycentric weights. Considering ABC and P again, the
interpolation weighting for attribute s at P can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\[ s_P = \frac{s_A * area(PBC) + s_B * area(PCA) + s_C * area(PAB)}{area(ABC)} \]
\label{weighting}
\end{equation}

Barycentric weights are a new one on me, but I can see how they could be derived
from A-level maths by considering the weightings as mass at the centre of 
a triangle and using moments.

%\cite{http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0101/}

If we consider the formula for area $A$ of the triangle $cpb$

\begin{equation}
\[ 2A = (x_p - x_c)(y_b - y_c)-(x_b - x_c)(y_p - y_c) \]
\label{area}
\end{equation}

we can see that as $x_b$, $y_b$, $x_c$ and $y_c$ are constant for the triangle
for all values of $p$, we can rewrite it as

\begin{equation}
\[ 2A = (x_p0 + \delta x - x_c)(y_b - y_c)-(x_b - x_c)(y_p0 + \delta y - y_c) \]
\label{areadelta}
\end{equation}

Substuting \ref{areadelta} into \ref{equation}, we end up with

\begin{equation}
\[ s_P = \frac{s_a * (A_a0+dx*Adx_a+dy*Ady_a) + s_b * (A_b0+dx*Adx_b+dy*Ady_b) + s_c * (A_c0+dx*Adx_c+dy*Ady_c)}{A_abc} \]
\end{equation}

which can be further reduced to:

\begin{equation}
\[ s_P = sA_0 + dx*(sAdx_a+sAdx_b+sAdx_c) + dy*(sAdy_a+sAdy_b+sAdy_c) \]
\end{equation}

and therefore:

\begin{equation}
\[ s_P = sA_0 + dx*sAdx + dy*sAdy \]
\label{weighting}
\end{equation}

and so we can see that there is a trivial interpolation in screen space 
for each of the attributes as we step from pixel to pixel. Sadly, for such
a useful result, it seems remarkably under-documented on the internet.

Now, going back to \ref{area}, it's a well-known result that this calculation
can also determine whether a triangle is specified as clockwise or counter-clockwise
and is commonly used as part of the hidden surface test to cull individual triangles.
This is possible as the sign of $area$ is negative if $p$ is to the right of the vector
$bc$. We can therefore also use this result to determine if the point $p$ is inside the
triangle $ABC$ by checking the signs of all three area calculations. In my usage,
I have considered the triangle $cpb$ and therefore I want $p$ to my on the right of $bc$
and therefore am expecting a negative sign.

As the sign is stored in the top bit of both signed integers and floats, a bitwise AND
of the areas of $cpb$, $bpa$ and $apc$ will have a MSB of 1 when inside the triangle and
peforming a logical right shift by 31 produces a word-size bitmask.

That describes the current state of the shader function in shader.c; the shaders in
oldshader.c show the linear interpolation of the attributes and various stages of
optimisation along the derivation of \ref{weighting}.


This seems to work well in practice, however my existing code uses floats through for
this calculation as originally I was calculating the area at each point. It is apparent
that a float isn't quite accurate enough to hold the summed areas when considering the
edges as occasionally there is the odd pixel tearing at the edges due to rounding.
However, it's clear that this edge calculation can be done in fixed precision, although
generally the attributes in \ref{weighting} must continue to be done in floating point
during the main loop, but can be easily derived from the area constants using just a
float scaling factor.

Block generation using Hilbert curves
-------------------------------------

Currently, a very simple approach to rendering blocks occurs - I calculate the minimum
block bounding box for the triangle, then test the corners of each block using the area
test to ensure that the box isn't completely outside the triangle. If any corner of the
box is inside the triangle or the triangle occurs wholly inside the block, we render
the block. The biggest downside of this approach is that we rasterise horizontally, then
vertically and due to the small size of the texture cache we have almost certainly lost
the texture blocks on each block that would be common with the line above.

The standard solution to this is using Hilbert curves to generate blocks that are always
spatially local to the previous block, which should cut down texture cache lookups by
around half. Moving to integers for the area and base for the weightings on each block
will be much more numerically stable as the block deltas will always be (2<<n)*dx and
(2<<n)*dy.

I had planned to maintain a list of triangles to render organised by blocks in an
attempt to minimise DMA on the render buffer (which will be quite large as it will also
include z-buffer and potentially in the future 2x2 AA). However, I think it'll actually
generate more DMA to maintain this list than to take the hit of reading the data more.

Texture cache
-------------

Most of the code for this is in texture.c. I currently use two vectors of 8 shorts
to provide 16 texture block caches (a texture block is a 32x32 pixel block with an
additional pre-fetched right and bottom edge, so 33x33 pixels in a 36x33 block in memory)

Checking the cache, requires the following test per pixel:

			vec_ushort8 copy_cmp_0 = (vec_ushort8) spu_shuffle(block_id,block_id,shuf_cmp_0);
			vec_ushort8 matches1_0 = spu_cmpeq(TEXcache1,copy_cmp_0);
			vec_ushort8 matches2_0 = spu_cmpeq(TEXcache2,copy_cmp_0);
			vec_uint4 gather1_0 = spu_gather((vec_uchar16)matches1_0);
			vec_uint4 gather2_0 = spu_gather((vec_uchar16)matches2_0);
			vec_uint4 gather_0 = spu_sel(gather1_0, gather2_0, gather_merge);

and to join them back up to 4 pixel's results and do the cache found test:

			vec_uint4 gather_01 = spu_shuffle(gather_0,gather_1,shuf_gath_01);
			vec_uint4 gather_23 = spu_shuffle(gather_2,gather_3,shuf_gath_23);
			tex_keep = spu_or(tex_keep, gather);
			vec_uint4 cache = spu_cntlz(gather);
			vec_uint4 cache_not_found = spu_cmpeq(cache,spu_splats((unsigned int)32));
			unsigned int cache_orx = spu_extract(spu_orx(cache_not_found),0);

An idea I had from the mipmapping level code where I wanted to increase the capacity of
the vector, it might be best to store high and low bytes seperately, with 16 entries in
each part-vector, so:

		copy_cmp_0_hi = spu_shuffle(block_id, block_id, shuf_cmp_0_hi);
		copy_cmp_0_lo = spu_shuffle(block_id, block_id, shuf_cmp_0_lo);
		matches_0 = spu_and(spu_cmpeq(TEXcache_hi, copy_cmp_0_hi),
				    spu_cmpeq(TEXcache_lo, copy_cmp_0_lo))
		gather_0 = spu_gather(matches_0);
		
The pipeline is slightly different in each case, neither seems to have a definite advantage
but probably the second is easier to extend to a 32 line cache, which would be beneficial
and there's probably sufficient space for increasing to 32 texture blocks cached (at
4*36*33=4752 bytes per block = 152064 bytes for 32 blocks)

Of perhaps more interest, if the texture is correctly mipmapped, it follows that there should
only be a maximum of 4 blocks at each mip-map level in a block (not confirmed experimentally)
so, assuming we don't have a really step perspective angle (which will kill the cache anyway)
we could pre-load these textures and use a smaller vector to hold all the possibles and
so need less calculations in the main loop.


Integer notes
-------------


Here are some notes about the floating point stuff:

Input vars:
		x,y [0..2]
		v_x_cw, v_x_ccw
		v_y_cw, y_y_ccw

v_by_to_cy = v_y_ccw - v_y_cw
face_mul = x * v_by_to_cy
face_sum = sum[face_mul:0..2]		(max 1920*1080*3 = 0x5eec00 = 23 bits)

base_area = [face_sum, 0, 0, 0]
fcgt_area = 0>base_area

area_dx = v_y_ccw - v_y_cw // cy->by	(max +-2*1080)
area_dy = v_x_cw - v_x_ccw // bx->cx	(max +-2*1920)

area_ofs = splats(x[0])*area_dx = splats(y[0])*area_dy

A_dx = area_dx
A_dy = area_dy

// offset within a block compared to pixel top left
A = block_left * area_dx + block_top * area_dy + (base_area-area_ofs)

Assumptions:

Highest resolution = 1920 * 1080
Need at least 11 bits of precision, will use 13.2 (8k*8k, 1/4 pix precision)

area_dx, area_dy can be at most 1920*1080 (0x1fa400, 22 bits inc sign) 
maximum extent in any direction = 11 bits




static inline vec_float4 extract(
	vec_float4 what, vec_float4 tAa, vec_float4 tAb, vec_float4 tAc)
{
	return	spu_madd(spu_splats(spu_extract(what,0)),tAa,
		spu_madd(spu_splats(spu_extract(what,1)),tAb,
		spu_mul (spu_splats(spu_extract(what,2)),tAc)));
}

	vec_float4 wA = extract(tri->w, Aa, Ab, Ac);
	vec_float4 wA_dx4 = extract(tri->w, Aa_dx4, Ab_dx4, Ac_dx4);
	vec_float4 wA_dy = extract(tri->w, Aa_dy, Ab_dy, Ac_dy);
...
			vec_float4 w = f1_0/wA;
			vec_float4 tf_s = spu_mul(sA, w);
			vec_float4 tf_t = spu_mul(tA, w);
...
		 A += spu_sel( A_dx4, A_dy,sel);
		Aa += spu_sel(Aa_dx4,Aa_dy,sel);
		Ab += spu_sel(Ab_dx4,Ab_dy,sel);
		Ac += spu_sel(Ac_dx4,Ac_dy,sel);
		wA += spu_sel(wA_dx4,wA_dy,sel);

wA = w[0] * Aa + w[1] * Ab + w[2] * Ac


Idea for rendering with diagonal deltas:

  0  1  5  6 14 15 27 28
  2  4  7 13 16 26 29 42
  3  8 12 17 25 30 41 43
  9 11 18 24 31 40 44 53
 10 19 23 32 39 45 52 54
 20 22 33 38 46 51 55 60
 21 34 37 47 50 56 59 61
 35 36 48 49 57 58 62 63

    0	0
 1  2	xq
 3  5	yrr
 6  9	xqqq
10 14	yrrrr
15 20	xqqqqq
21 27	yrrrrrr
28 35	xqqqqqqq
36 42	xrrrrrr
43 48	yqqqqq
49 53	xrrrr
54 57	yqqq
58 60	xrr
61 62	yq
   63	x

q=-x,+y
r=+x,-y

But does it actually gain anything? Still need to store values for each
fragment if not doing entire block.

static inline vec_int4 log2_sqrt_clamp(vec_float4 a, vec_int4 adjust) {
        qword ra = (qword) a;
        qword rb = (qword) adjust;

        qword t3 = si_rotmai(t2,-31);
        qword t4 = si_andc(t2a,t3);
        return (vec_int4) t4;
}


                        vec_int4 mipmap_real = log2_sqrt_clamp(k*w*w*w, adjust);                        // det

                        vec_uint4 mipmap_clamp_sel = spu_cmpgt(max_mipmap,mipmap_real);
                        vec_int4 mipmap = spu_sel(max_mipmap,mipmap_real,mipmap_clamp_sel);             // cla
