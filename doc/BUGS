ACTIVE BUGS

* clear screen function should use custom shader to avoid extra reads

* DMA alignment exception when running with borders

* with more than one render SPU, sometimes stuff glitches out of view
  - this looks suspiciously like it's caused with the triangle buffer
    is too small, meaning the "check for space" function is broken...

* can get DMA exception if client quits - server must hold off trashing
  buffers until after render stuff has had a chance to complete

* doesn't check buffer extents on DMA

Still occurring

* on gimel:
	Render of 960 frames took 16.086914 seconds or 59.675835 FPS
  on ps3:
	Render of 960 frames took 34.705139 seconds or 27.661610 FPS

RESOLVED

* crashes when daemon run directly, but fine from make
  - works fine on jap ps3, only happens on uk ps3

Turned out to be running directly, mmap range is at end of address space
(f7fcd00), but running from make it's at the beginning of heap (4081b000).

The newer kernel only allocates a single-buffered screen and so running from
make I was trampling over heap but it wasn't getting caught, running directly
caused an exception as that address space wasn't mapped.

* spugld PPU-side takes 37% CPU doing almost nothing when a client is connected
  - actually it's all the memset on the framebuffer :O

Made the screen clear function use a triangle that covers the entire screen.
Still room to optimise this, but it's a start.
PPU usage is about 10% - still not sure what it's doing, but not too bothered.

* client's FIFO doesn't wrap around yet

Added spuglSetTarget function to change the FIFO write ptr
