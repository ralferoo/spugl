* crashes when daemon run directly, but fine from make
  - works fine on jap ps3, only happens on uk ps3

* spugld PPU-side takes 37% CPU doing almost nothing when a client is connected
  - actually it's all the memset on the framebuffer :O

* with more than one render SPU, sometimes stuff glitches out of view

* on gimel:
	Render of 960 frames took 16.086914 seconds or 59.675835 FPS
  on ps3:
	Render of 960 frames took 34.705139 seconds or 27.661610 FPS
