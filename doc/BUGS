ACTIVE BUGS

* spugld PPU-side takes 37% CPU doing almost nothing when a client is connected
  - actually it's all the memset on the framebuffer :O

* on gimel:
	Render of 960 frames took 16.086914 seconds or 59.675835 FPS
  on ps3:
	Render of 960 frames took 34.705139 seconds or 27.661610 FPS

RESOLVED

* crashes when daemon run directly, but fine from make
  - works fine on jap ps3, only happens on uk ps3

Turned out to be running directly, mmap range is at end of address space
(f7fcd00), but running from make it's at the beginning of heap (4081b000).

The newer kernel only allocates a single-buffered screen and so running from
make I was trampling over heap but it wasn't getting caught, running directly
caused an exception as that address space wasn't mapped.

* with more than one render SPU, sometimes stuff glitches out of view

Seems to have been caused by the bug above
