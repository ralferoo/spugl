R0 (LR)    Dedicated    Return Address / Link Register. This register contains
			the address to which a called function normally returns.
			It is volatile across function calls and must be saved
			by a non-leaf function.
R1 (SP)    Dedicated    Stack pointer information. Word element 0 of the SP
			register contains the current stack pointer. The stack
			pointer is always 16-byte aligned, and it must always
			point to the lowest allocated valid stack frame and
			grow towards low addresses. The contents of the word
			at the stack-frame address always point to the previous
			allocated stack frame. Word element 1 of the SP register
			contains the number of bytes of Available Stack Space.
			See section “2.2.2. The Stack Frame” for more details.
R2         Volatile     Environment pointer. This register is used as an
			environment pointer for languages that require one.
R3  – R74  Volatile     First 72 quadwords of a function’s argument list and
			its return value.
R75 – R79  Volatile     Scratch Registers.
R80 – R127 Non-volatile Local variable registers. These must be preserved
			across function calls.
