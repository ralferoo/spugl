			Production rules for Hilbert curve
			----------------------------------

             A       B       C       D		->	ABCD

type 0:      0       y       x+y     x		->	1003
type 1:      0       x       x+y     y		->	0112
type 2:      x+y     x       0       y		->	3221
type 3:      x+y     y       0       x		->	2330

Productions from type T are (T^1),T,T,(T^3)

A and C rules are decided by bit 1 of T
B and D rules are deicded by (bit 1 of T) ^ (bit 0 of T)
