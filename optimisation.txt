			Texture mapping block allocation
			--------------------------------

Texture size is 8192x8192 -> 256mb; this is 256x256 blocks
Therefore, assume max is 4096x4096 -> 64mb; this is 128x128 blocks.
For mipmapping 256x256 blocks -> 1x1 blocks, will need maximum of 9 levels
9*14 bits=126 bits

n + 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024 + 4096 + 16384 = n + 21845
bits:	5    6	  7    9     11	    13	    15

A: 16 * lo(blk)
B: 16 * hi(blk)

blk_base = shuffle(shuffle(3 13 3 13 7 17 7 17 b 1b b 1b f 1f f 1f,mipmap,mipmap+10),A,B)


				Hilbert optimisations
				---------------------

data_modified
-------------

"counter" that indicates that a group of blocks has been changed.

last_read_ptr
-------------

one per block, sorted in hilbert order for ease of accessing when drawing a block.
holds a pointer to the last read address (same as next_write_ptr).
initially set to &block_deference_ptrs[hilbert(n)] for each n in array.

next_write_ptr
--------------

one per block, sorted in screen order.
holds a pointer to the next write address (same as the last_read_ptr).
initially set to &block_deference_ptrs[n] for each n in array.

triangle_structure
------------------

<triangle_data>

n * <triangle_block>

triangle_block
--------------

<per_block_data> (inc pointer to triangle_structure)
next_triangle:	pointer to next triangle_block (this is the target of the next_write_ptr/last_read_ptr)
	
block_deference_ptrs
--------------------

blocks_wide * blocks_height, initially set to NULL


Reading Algorithm
-----------------

For a given group, see if the data_modified has changed.
Lock group of blocks
If so, DMA the appropriate subset of last_read_ptr
Build up DMA list of reads for each entry, i.e. contents of next_triangle for each block
For each block:
	If the next_triangle is not-null:
		Fetch the per-triangle / triangle data
		Fetch the current block pixel and z data
		Add to processing list
		Mark subset as changed
		Increment processing count

At end of processing list for a block:
	Update subset of last_read_ptr
	Decrement processing count, if zero:
		Start read of next data_modified / last_read_ptr
		Write last_read_ptr subset
	Write block pixel and z data
	if count was zero:
		Unlock group of blocks

Writing Algorithm
-----------------

(last_write_ptr array is all in LS)

Add triangle data to end of list buffer
Start DMA 
For each block in triangle:
	Add per block data to end of list buffer (inc ptr to triangle)
	Add this to DMA list
	Store this block pointer in LS
	Add this to DMA list to update the last block's next pointer
	Update last_write_ptr with this &block.next
	Start DMA

At some point, need to reset the triangle output buffer....


When the buffer is looking somewhat "fullish":
	DMA the last_read_ptr table
	If there is a non-null ptr that is >= ENDPOINT:
		Abort
	Else:
		We can start waiting until it's fullish

When the buffer is looking "fullish":
	DMA the last_read_ptr table
	Find the lowest, non-null ptr -> ENDPOINT
	Can restart back at 0, but cannot recycle beyond ENDPOINT
	Initially, create fake triangles for all buffers to push the buffers back to the start again
